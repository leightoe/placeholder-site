    <h1>server died</h1>
    <br>
    <p>this site was running on a computer that can fit in the palm of my hand, and it finally died.</p>
    <br>
    <p>due to the lack of donations & motivation,</p><p style="color:red"> i have no plans on bringing this site back, unless im super bored tonight.</p>
